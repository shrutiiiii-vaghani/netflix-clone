# Netflix Clone - MERN Stack (2024)

This is a Netflix clone project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The clone allows users to browse and watch trailers, authenticate using JWT, and manage content like movies and TV shows.

## Project Overview

This project is based on a full tutorial on how to build a Netflix clone using the MERN stack in 2024. The application includes features like user authentication, movie browsing, and a functional UI for watching trailers and adding shows to a personalized list.


## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **Movie/TV Show Browsing**: Users can browse through a list of movies and TV shows, with details fetched from a backend database.
- **Trailers**: Watch trailers for different movies/shows directly within the app.
